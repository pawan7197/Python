```
 8. Install Python 3 Virtual Environment Package
```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
```
it Installs the python3-venv package to enable Python virtual environments.

9. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```
What it does: Creates a virtual environment named myenv.

 10. Activate the Virtual Environment
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```
What it does: Activates the myenv virtual environment.

 11. Install Flask
```bash
pip3 install flask
```
What it does: Installs Flask, a micro web framework for Python.

 12. Run the Voting App

```
 16. Set File Permissions for app.py
 ```bash
chmod +x app.py
```
17. Check App Ownership
```bash
sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu app.py
```
What it does: Changes the ownership of app.py to the ubuntu user.

 18. View the App in the Browser
  ```bash
 browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000. You should see the voting app running.
